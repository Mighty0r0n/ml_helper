## To-Do

- [ ] Add third party logging. Stuff like cv is still excluded when verbose=3
- [ ] Add code for pd.DataFrames
  - [ ] Add code for column datastats(min, max, std, nunique, etc)
- [ ] Maybe think of class Strucure. Benefting here?
- [ ] Is there an auto doc generator, similiar to the one in java generating an HTTPS doc?
- [ ] Implement the following, since QueueHandler somehow cant parse get handlers: in config. Did [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L77QExPmI0) used a different Version? how?
  - ![LoggerClass](./documentation/img.png)
